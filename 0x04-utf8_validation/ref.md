if continuation_bytes == 0:
    if integer < 0x80:  # ASCII character (single-byte).
        continue
    elif integer >= 0xC0 and integer <= 0xFD:
        # The leading bits indicate a multi-byte character.
        # Count the number of leading '1' bits
        # to determine the number of bytes in this character.
        mask = 0x80
        while (integer & mask):
            continuation_bytes += 1
            mask >>= 1

        # The first byte of a multi-byte
        # character should have the correct number of leading '1' bits.
        if continuation_bytes < 2 or continuation_bytes > 4:
            return False
        continuation_bytes -= 1  # Decrement to account for this first byte.
    else:
        return False  # Invalid leading bits.
```

Let's explain this code step by step in layman's terms while maintaining a technical perspective:

1. `continuation_bytes` is a variable used to keep track of how many continuation bytes are expected for a multi-byte character. In UTF-8, the leading byte of a multi-byte character tells us how many continuation bytes follow.

2. The code starts by checking if we are not expecting any continuation bytes. This is relevant for the beginning of the sequence and for the start of a new character.

3. If the integer falls within the range of 0x80 (128 in decimal) to 0xFD (253 in decimal), it means the leading bits indicate a multi-byte character. This range is defined by UTF-8 encoding rules for the first byte of multi-byte characters.

4. The code uses a `mask` to examine the leading bits of the integer. It starts with a mask representing the leftmost bit (0x80) and then shifts this mask to the right one bit at a time to check each bit in the integer.

5. For each leading '1' bit encountered, the `continuation_bytes` counter is incremented. This helps determine how many continuation bytes are expected for this character. If the byte starts with '110' (binary), it means two bytes are expected; '1110' means three bytes, and '11110' means four bytes.

6. After determining the number of continuation bytes, the code checks if it's within the valid range (2 to 4 bytes) specified by UTF-8 rules. If it's not within this range, it indicates an error in the encoding.

7. The `continuation_bytes` counter is then decremented by 1 to account for the first byte. This leaves us with the number of remaining continuation bytes to check in the subsequent iterations of the loop.

8. If the integer doesn't fall within the valid ranges or has an invalid pattern in the leading bits, it's considered an error in the UTF-8 encoding, and the function returns `False`.

In summary, the code is checking the byte patterns at the beginning of a character in the UTF-8 sequence to determine if it's the start of a character and, if so, how many continuation bytes are expected. This is done in accordance with the UTF-8 encoding rules to ensure that the input sequence adheres to those rules and represents valid UTF-8-encoded characters.


The initialization of `mask` with 128 (0x80 in hexadecimal) and the subsequent iteration to the right while increasing `continuation_bytes` are part of a bitwise operation to analyze the leading bits of the integer, which is a common technique for working with binary data. Here's why it's done this way:

1. **Mask Initialization with 0x80 (128 in decimal)**:
   - In UTF-8, the leading bit in a byte that represents a multi-byte character is always set to '1'. Therefore, it's common practice to start with the leftmost bit (most significant bit) in a byte and check if it's '1'.
   - The binary representation of 0x80 is 10000000, with only the leftmost bit set to '1'. By using this as a mask, you can perform bitwise AND operations with the integer to check the state of the leftmost bit.

2. **Iteration to the Right and Increasing `continuation_bytes`**:
   - The `mask` is initially set to 0x80 (10000000 in binary).
   - The code iterates through the bits of the integer from left to right by repeatedly shifting the `mask` one bit to the right.
   - With each shift, the code checks whether the corresponding bit in the integer is '1'.
   - If the bit being checked is '1', it means that this bit is part of the leading bits for a multi-byte character, so `continuation_bytes` is increased to indicate that there is one more continuation byte in the sequence.

3. **Condition `elif integer >= 0xC0 and integer <= 0xFD`**:
   - The condition `elif integer >= 0xC0 and integer <= 0xFD` is used to identify bytes that are potentially the start of a multi-byte character.
   - In UTF-8, the first byte of a multi-byte character must fall within the range of 0xC0 to 0xFD to ensure that the representation is correct.
   - This condition is responsible for identifying the start of a multi-byte character and initializing the `mask` and `continuation_bytes` for processing its leading bits.

In summary, the `mask` and the bitwise AND operations are used to examine the leading bits of the byte to determine the number of continuation bytes required for a multi-byte character. The condition `elif integer >= 0xC0 and integer <= 0xFD` ensures that the byte under examination is a potential start of a multi-byte character according to UTF-8 encoding rules. These operations collectively help validate the correctness of the UTF-8 sequence being processed in the code.
